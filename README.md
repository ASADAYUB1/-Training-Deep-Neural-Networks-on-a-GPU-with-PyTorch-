# Training-Deep-Neural-Networks-on-a-GPU-with-PyTorch
This repository comprises code files where I explore both the MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset and the Fashion-MNIST dataset. 
Initially, I worked with images in PyTorch, conducting tasks such as splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets, creating PyTorch models, interpreting model outputs, and selecting appropriate evaluation metrics. 
Subsequently, I delved into more advanced tasks, including creating a deep neural network with hidden layers, implementing a non-linear activation function, utilizing GPU acceleration for faster training, and experimenting with hyperparameters to enhance model performance.
